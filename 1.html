<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>

<p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the language of the web. When
you go to a web page in your web browser such as Internet Explorer,
Firefox, or Safari, the browser downloads and displays HTML.</p>


<p>At its heart, HTML is just a document, much the same as a document you’d
make in a word processor. A program like Microsoft Word is used to view
word processor documents <strong>because it knows <u>how to read and display</u>
 them.</strong>
Likewise, when it comes to the web, the web browser is the program that
knows how to read and display documents created with HTML.</p>

<p>Word processor documents can be created and read with a single program.
On the other hand, HTML documents need different programs for creation
and reading; you can’t create HTML documents with a browser. You create
HTML documents using a program called an editor. This editor can be as
simple as the Notepad program that comes with Microsoft Windows or as
complex as Eclipse or Microsoft Visual Studio. You can typically use the
same program to create HTML documents that you use to create PHP programs.
This chapter describes HTML documents and shows how to build an HTML
page that you can view through a web browser using the most current version,
HTML5.</p  >
